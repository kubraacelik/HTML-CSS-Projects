## Nike-Site
The project appears to be a simple and visually appealing layout designed to showcase and promote the Nike Dunk Low Panda product. The circles and lines in the design add a modern and dynamic aesthetic. Preconnect links are set up for Google Fonts. The right column of the product features an image in a circle and uses decorative circle elements.
